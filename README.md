# Hi there! I'm Tom√°s üëã

## ü§ì About me 
üöÄ My name is Tom√°s Sassone, and I'm a Software Development student from Argentina, 
planning to gradutate in late-2024. I'm currently looking for my first work experience in the IT field.

üìì I'm currently working in my college assigments and a few personal projects.
At the moment I'm learning C#, .NET and Linux. I also have skills in Python, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS.

üéÆ I love trying new technologies and learning about the latest advances in the field.
Outside of the world of tech, I also enjoy playing videogames, hip-hop music and sci-fi movies.
